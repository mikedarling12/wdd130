            <h1>About Board Game Scouting</h1>
            <p>Board Game was started by Michael Darling, a college student who loved board games, and who wanted an easier way to find new games to buy. Such a search led Michael to make this site, to make buying board games easier for others. Having played a lot of board games himself, he knows that while many games a good, others stand out differently, and he highlights these differences to help you find the best purchase as efficiently as possible. Take a look at his board game reviews and see for yourself!</p>
