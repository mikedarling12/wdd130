            <h1>Here to Slay</h1>
            <p>A simple card game with fun pictures. In this role-playing game, which feels reminiscent of other popular role-playing games like 
                DnD, you pick from one of six fantasy classes, each based on a different animal. Throughout the game, you compete to either 
                assemble all of the classes, or take down three vicious monsters. With two different ways to win, each appealing to different 
                audiences, its a must-try for any group of gamers!</p>

            <h1>Exploding Kittens</h1>
            <p>Exploding kittens is a simple-to-pick-up, yet still super chaotic game. Exploding kittens makes an interesting spin on Russian 
                Roulette, where the deck is rigged with a, you guessed it, exploding kitten. But each player has tools at their disposal to try 
                and avoid this dangerous kitty. With a bit of skill, and a lot of luck, you will be the last man standing! At an affordable price 
                and with plenty of expansions, the deck will constantly keep you and your friends on your toes for plenty of replayability.</p>
