            <h1>Pixel Tactics</h1>
            <p>Pixel tactics is a interesting game that brings the fantasy battlefield combat to the table. In this two-player game, each goes 
                head to head with decks brimming with fiends, wizards, gunslinger, and more! But each card can be used in so many ways! You could 
                put the wizard as on the front-line to use protective spells, on the rear to launch powerful spells from behind, or even lead you 
                team with that same wizard. No matter how many times you play, there is always something new to try that will surprise you.</p>

            <h1>War Chest</h1>
            <p>For those who are familiar with Chess, this game may have a familiar ring. In this tabletop battlefield game, each player randomly 
                picks 4 of 16 available troop-types based on medieval soldiers. Each soldier has its own special ability, and players must 
                strategically maneuver their army across the map to capture designated control points before their opponent does. But they must 
                be careful, as once a troop is defeated, it is gone for the remainder of the game. Additionally, actions are determined using a 
                drawbag filled with tokens. A deeply satisfying game with plenty of replayability.</p>
