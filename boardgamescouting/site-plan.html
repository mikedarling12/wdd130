      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about the last time you bought something online. There is so much info out there, and that can be overwhelming at times, especially when it comes to buying board games. That is where I come in. I love playing board games, but I want to make the buying part easier. On my website, I give you the basics about some of the best games out there, such as the kind of experience to expect (after all, not everyone wants to buy a party game for a two-player experience.) You can use this handy guide I provide to see if a certain game is as interesting as you thought, or even find new prospects. Either way, this will be your go-to spot to begin looking for your next board game purchase.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is those who enjoy board games, but they either don't have the time or don't want to do a ton of research. There is a ton of info out there, but this website is aimed and simplifying the process for those people. This way, they can spend less time picking out the game and more time playing the game they ordered, with the same satisfaction of playing a new game that was heavily researched.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>About Board Game Scouting</h2>
      <p>
        Board Game was started by Michael Darling, a college student who loved board games, and who wanted an easier way to find new games to buy. Such a search led Michael to make this site, to make buying board games easier for others. Having played a lot of board games himself, he knows that while many games a good, others stand out differently, and he highlights these differences to help you find the best purchase as efficiently as possible. Take a look at his board game reviews and see for yourself!

      <h2>Here to Slay</h2>
      <p>
        Here to Slay-
A simple card game with fun pictures. In this role-playing game, which feels reminiscent of other popular role-playing games like DnD, you pick from one of six fantasy classes, each based on a different animal. Throughout the game, you compete to either assemble all of the classes, or take down three vicious monsters. With two different ways to win, each appealing to different audiences, its a must-try for any group of gamers!
