      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about the last time you bought something online. There is so much info out there, and that can be overwhelming at times, especially when it comes to buying board games. That is where I come in. I love playing board games, but I want to make the buying part easier. On my website, I give you the basics about some of the best games out there, such as the kind of experience to expect (after all, not everyone wants to buy a party game for a two-player experience.) You can use this handy guide I provide to see if a certain game is as interesting as you thought, or even find new prospects. Either way, this will be your go-to spot to begin looking for your next board game purchase.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is those who enjoy board games, but they either don't have the time or don't want to do a ton of research. There is a ton of info out there, but this website is aimed and simplifying the process for those people. This way, they can spend less time picking out the game and more time playing the game they ordered, with the same satisfaction of playing a new game that was heavily researched.</p>  <!-- change this -->

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
