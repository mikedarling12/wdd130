    <h2>Michael Darling</h2>
    <h2>"Mike"</h2>
    <p>Hey Y'all! I am Michael, but I also go by Mike. I am single and currently love doing almost anything revolving around games, 
        let it be board, card, or video games.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am majoring in Computer Science, though without an specific focus on anything yet. 
        One potential idea is web-design, as I did it for an internship once, but only time will tell if that is what I want to do.
        I don't have a job due to returning from a mission recently, but I intend to get one soon.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ my whole life, and it has been an immeasurable blessing in my life. 
        All throughout schooling, I could see a distinct difference between my life and theirs. 
        But even as I served a mission, my love for the Restored Gospel has only grown. Not only had 
        it changed my life, but it also changed theirs'!
